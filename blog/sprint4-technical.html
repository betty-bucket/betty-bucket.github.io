        <h1>That time I got stuck on a JavaScript problem</h1>
            <h2>A Simple Problem</h2>
                <p>
                    Well I don't know about you, but I had some big blocks on the fizzbuzzed challenge! And as predicted by what Joseph was saying in the videos, I totally got blocked on how functions work (particularly the words inside the brackets!). Even after watching the video explaining it and thinking I understood, it's only now I realise that I still didn't quite get it!
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, I didn't realise that in the function super_fizzbuzz (<em>arr</em>) {some instructions for the function} that it doesn't matter what (<em>arr</em>)  is named and that it doesn't mean anything until you call (or in other words actually use) the function. It is not a string, it is not an array. It's just nothing until it is called. This was hard for me to get my head around because it felt like I was having to think in a non-linear order. The hardest part of learning JavaScript has been getting used to the non-linear order of things and how it feels like things are jumping back and forth all over the place. And maybe once all this information is grounded I'll be saying it's so linear and logical. Who knows?!
                </p>
                <p>
                    So how did I solve this conundrum? Well because I already had the code (by way of copying and pasting from the internet and referencing the sample solutions to double check), I knew I just needed some help by peers/coaches to explain how it was working to me. I reached out to my facilitator who explained it in one way, and then when I got confused by this same thing in the next kata I reached out to my peers who explained it in a different way. It took about 3-4 people explaining this concept for it to finally sink in enough for me to be able to explain it to myself (sort of like the rubber ducky method but talking to myself with my flatmates around me)! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout this process I felt quite lost and when you really don't understand something, it's hard to even ask the right questions. I find this the most frustrating part of the learning process, when you know so little, that even asking a question feels like you need some knowledge first to be able to ask a good one! But I think in the end, through a combination of problem solving techniques it is possible to get there!
                </p>
            <h2>An Elegant Solution</h2>
                <p>
                    Elegant isn't the first word I would use to describe my problem solving. But I would say I'm proud of the learning process I took in the "Built-in Methods" kata. By this point, I had gained some experience and now felt like I could approach a problem and ask better questions. An example of this was writing the code for the capitalise function. In this instance I knew this would likely be a commonly asked question so I simply googled it, found an answer on Stackoverflow and copied and pasted their code into mine and adjusted any word differences as necessary. From memory, this didn't work straight away so I think I checked the sample solution and then researched the .substring function on MDN. I found MDN really useful for diving deep into the particulars of the code to deepen my understanding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once I had fixed my code so it passed the test, I wanted to see for myself that it was working so I console.logged it. It did capitalise the beginning of each word! Yay! So then I messed around with the capitalise function to see what would break it or work differently so that I could get a good understanding of the function. For example I wanted to understand the .split function so I played around with the parameter it was being split by being " " or "," or ";" and console.logging each time to see the result. I have to say it was satisfying to understand what was happening at each part and stage of the capitalise function!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout this process, I felt calm and trusted I could learn and understand the code required to solve the problem. I learnt that there is always a solution out there, someone has probably explained it well and there is no one way of writing code that works. But if it works then hooray!
                </p>
        <h1>The problem solving techniques</h1>
            <h2>Pseudocode</h2>
                <p>
                    I use this a bit, mainly to copy and paste the task and then any questions I might have for trying to solve the task.
                </p>
            <h2>Trying Something</h2>
                <p>
                    This one is high on my list of problem solving techniques. Now that I know I can't really break things, I just type some (rubbish) code in and cross my fingers to see if it worked.
                </p>
            <h2>Rubber Ducky Method</h2>
                <p>
                    If talking to yourself counts as the Rubber Ducky Method, then yes. I use this method frequently. My partner thinks I'm losing it or echoes me talking in binary.
                </p>
            <h2>Reading Error Messages</h2>
                <p>
                    These have been pretty useful to me to see where I've gone wrong. Sometimes it's just a syntax error but then sometimes it prompts me something else where I realise I really don't understand and need to go on a googling journey.
                </p>
            <h2>Console.logging</h2>
                <p>
                    I surprised myself by actually using this technique! I used it throughout the katas to validate the functions working (it was nice to see the output of the function as well vs. just knowing the function passed the test).
                </p>
            <h2>Googling</h2>
                <p>
                    Googling stuff is probably number 1 on the list. Even if you ask a poor question, you can sometimes found yourself at the right question and then at the solution!
                </p>
            <h2>Asking Your Peers For Help</h2>
                <p>
                    The slack channel is awesome. I've asked questions there myself and definitely keep a regular eye on it because, often people are getting stuck or confused in similar places.
                </p>
            <h2>Asking Coaches For Help</h2>
                <p>
                    For the times that I really don't understand what's going on, or how to ask the right question, going to my facilitator has been the comforting safety net of the whole process. I've had an extra catch up to help me through the code and have asked a bunch of confusing questions which have always helped me get closer to understanding.
                </p>
            <h2>Improving Your Process With Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    Doing all these technical blogs has been awesome for my learning process as it's explaining in plain english what I've learnt and discovered each week. In fact, I'm going to write all these techniques down in my journal as a checklist to go through if I get stuck on a problem!
                </p>
