    <h1>The difference between HTML and CSS</h1>
        <p>
            If you're looking at a website, it will consist of both HTML and CSS. If you were to think of HTML and CSS as characters, HTML would be the builder and CSS would be the artist. The artist cannot exist/do their job, without the builder laying the foundations before them. HTML is what gives your website all it's structure and the elements inside that structure. Such as your navigation bar, your headings, your paragraphs, your pictures and anything else you might wish to put on a website. CSS is going to determine what all of this looks like. Whether it makes your headings have a font of 'comic-sans', your background bright pink, or make your main picture wildly huge or teency tiny. By the power of HTML and CSS, you have the power to make your own beautifully customisable website!
        </p>    
        <p>
            ... so what is JavaScript and how does that fit in? If JavaScript were a character it would be the sorceress. A badass witchy womxn making the website interactive and doing magical things. It basically does everything else that a website can do. It can even change your HTML and CSS content!

    <h1>Control Flow and Loops</h1>
        <p>
            Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones).
        </p>
        <p>
            Control flow is the order in which the computer executes a script.
        </p>
        <p>
            Looping in programming languages is a feature which facilitates the execution of a set of instructions/functions repeatedly while some conditions execute to true.
        </p>
        <P>
            Control flow is the order in which all the stuff in our code is executed. Imagine if control flow in coding was like doing the laundry.  We need to do first fill up our laundry basket with dirty clothing, put it into the washing machine, add laundry powder, turn the washing machine on and then finally once it's all clean, hang it out to dry! It wouldn't make sense to hang our dirty laundry out to dry and then put the washing machine on without anything in it! This is why control flow is important as it takes all the instructions needed to complete a certain task, and puts them all in a flowing order.
        </P>
        <p>
            Looping, in this analogy, could be the repetitive chugging of the washing machine as it completes a certain amount of chugs before it knows to move onto the next phase of the washing cycle. This loop is a repetitive task that needs to be completed a certain number of times before the task is considered done (or in the coding world - when a function has been executed to a defined amount of times).

    <h1>What is the DOM?</h1>
        <p>
           DOM stands for 'Document Object Model'. Maybe not quite as sexy as you might have thought but it can still be cool. The DOM is the special glue that ties HTML, CSS and JavaScript together. It's the programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It's the representation of the webpage.
        </p>
        <p>
            The page content is stored in the DOM and may be accessed and manipulated via JavaScript.

            What are they and why are they useful?
