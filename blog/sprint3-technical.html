    <h1>The difference between HTML and CSS</h1>
        <p>
            If you're looking at a website, it will consist of both HTML and CSS. If you were to think of HTML and CSS as characters, HTML would be the builder and CSS would be the artist. The artist cannot exist/do their job, without the builder laying the foundations before them. HTML is what gives your website all it's structure and the elements inside that structure. Such as your navigation bar, your headings, your paragraphs, your pictures and anything else you might wish to put on a website. CSS is going to determine what all of this looks like. Whether it makes your headings have a font of 'comic-sans', your background bright pink, or make your main picture wildly huge or teency tiny. By the power of HTML and CSS, you have the power to make your own beautifully customisable website!

            ... so what is JavaScript and how does that fit in? If JavaScript were a character it would be the sorceress. A badass witchy womxn making the website interactive and doing magical things. It basically does everything else that a website can do. It can even change your HTML and CSS content!
