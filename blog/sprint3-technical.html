    <h1>The difference between HTML and CSS</h1>
        <p>
            If you're looking at a website, it will consist of both HTML and CSS. If you were to think of HTML and CSS as characters, HTML would be the builder and CSS would be the artist. The artist cannot exist/do their job, without the builder laying the foundations before them. HTML is what gives your website all it's structure and the elements inside that structure. Such as your navigation bar, your headings, your paragraphs, your pictures and anything else you might wish to put on a website. CSS is going to determine what all of this looks like. Whether it makes your headings have a font of 'comic-sans', your background is bright pink, or your main picture wildly huge or teency tiny. By the power of HTML and CSS, you have the power to make your own beautifully customisable website!
        </p>    
        <p>
            ... so what is JavaScript and how does that fit in? If JavaScript were a character it would be the sorceress. A badass witchy womxn making the website interactive and doing magical things. It basically does everything else that a website can do. It can even change your HTML and CSS content!

    <h1>Control Flow and Loops</h1>
        <P>
            Control flow is the order in which all the stuff in our code is executed. Imagine if control flow in coding was like doing the laundry.  First, we need to fill up our laundry basket with dirty clothing, put the contents into the washing machine, add laundry powder, turn the washing machine on and then finally once it's all clean, hang it out to dry! It wouldn't make sense to hang our dirty laundry out to dry and then put the washing machine on without anything in it! This is why control flow is important as it takes all the instructions needed to complete a certain task, and puts them all in a flowing order.
        </P>
        <p>
            Looping, in this analogy, could be the repetitive chugging of the washing machine as it completes a certain amount of chugs before it knows to move onto the next phase of the washing cycle. This loop is a repetitive task that needs to be completed a certain number of times before the task is considered done (or in the coding world - when a function has been executed to a set amount of times).
        </p>
    <h1>What is the DOM?</h1>
        <p>
            DOM stands for 'Document Object Model'. And no, it's not the coding overlord in bondage gear... The DOM is actually the special glue that ties HTML, CSS and JavaScript together. It's the programming interface for HTML and it is the object-oriented representation of a webpage.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we open up our Dev Tools (in chrome say), this is the visual represntation of the DOM. And yeah! It looks pretty similar to the HTML code that's written behind it. The DOM can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript (which the browser reads) and inside the DOM is where all the stuff happens. What kind of stuff you say? Well it could be stuff like watching and waiting for a mouseclick or a keyboard stroke and then the reaction that happens is going to be visible in the DOM.
        </p>
    <h1>Accessing data from arrays and objects</h1>
        <p>
            Both arrays and objects store data. But they do so in different ways that can be useful for different purposes. In arrays, the order of the data matters and is assigned a numerical value (in [square brackets]), whereas in objects, it lists all the properties of an object by a key. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So when would we be most likely to use an array? It would be better to use an array when we want to store a bunch of numbers or have a list of objects of the same type. Arrays can contain strings, numbers, bools, objects and even another array! We might have an array that lists all the items in your top kitchen drawer: Forks, knives, spoons and reusable straws. Forks (as it is the first value in this list) would be assigned a value of [0] and reuasble straws would be assigned [3] as it's fourth in line (remember that arrays start counting from 0).
        </p>
        <p>
            Objects on the other hand are more useful when you want to define an something that has varying types of properties. For example, you might use objects to list all the information you are interested in about a client. Their name, age, occupation, address or even favourite ice-cream. Storing information like this in an object is useful because you can then call upon the key value (e.g. occupation) that you are interested in for a particular object. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In truth you can use arrays and objects interchangably. What might make you choose one or the other is the preference you might have for calling out that information or what you are trying to do with that information.
        </p>
    <h1>Functions!</h1>
        <p>
            A function is essentially a statement that performs a task or calculates a value. Functions are the building blocks of JavaScript and it's very rare to be using JavaScript without them!
        </p>
        <p>
            The way it works is that a function gets called and then the function does something... It's sort of as simple as that! But it gets far more complex in practice. They help make our code reusable and they're always going to give us something in return. So far I've learnt that it might not be what I intended but it's always going to do what I tell it to!
