    <h1>Identities, Values and Strengths</h1>
    <h3>My core values</h3>
    
    <p>
        I value honesty, thoroughness, accessibility, transparency, and vulnerability or showing up.
    </p>
    <h3>An ethical decision that I had to make</h3>
        <p>
            A situation where a work colleague requested information about a file that related to them and their personal circumstances without going through the appropriate channels. The content of the information was highly sensitive and from an empathetic viewpoint, I could see why they wanted the information. However, they were abusing their position in the organisation to get that information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to the highly sensitive nature of the file, I did not feel it was fair to simply hold them to account in a stern manner. After my initial shock, I consulted with management and we came to the conclusion that a soft approach that took the colleagues situation into account would be best. Their request was rejected and they were pointed towards the appropriate channels for requesting that information. The gentle wording of the emails was important in this context as well as informing management that if they needed to speak with the colleague, that they also took a gentle approach.
        </p>
        <p>
            The issue was resolved (as far as I knew at the time) and management were appreciative of my soft but firm approach to the situation.
        </p>
    <h3>How culture has influenced my identity</h3>
        <p>
            From my family I learnt to be kind, honest and hard working. I learnt to play and from a young age I had a lot of emphasis on extra-curricular activities (even though my parents themselves didn’t have many/any extra hobbies). I think what was missing from that family environment was a maternal/unconditional type of love and instead a more paternal/conditional type of love was present. So if I did good at school or was a certain way it felt good. But as soon as the extra-curricular activities turned professional/competitive, I did not have the emotional skills to understand that my achievements were not related to my worthiness for love and acceptance. This type of emotional education (or lack thereof) was continued throughout school. In school there was an emphasis on learning stuff and maybe some critical thinking... but very little (or none) was put on learning soft skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            I big part of my identity and culture now is my circus life. This has heavily influenced my values and identity because of the physical and creative challenge. It’s an inclusive community and there is a significant overlap between circus artists and political activism that seeks to extend this value of inclusivity further.
        </p>
            Values that I have really taken away from circus is letting go, inclusiveness, and being able to achieve anything you set your mind to. In this community I have learnt and have become connected to people who further those soft skills that were lacking in my childhood.
        </p>
    <h3>Strengths and Limitations in terms of learning and career development</h3>
        <p>
            I believe I have a lot of good tools for learning and have developed a lot of good practice over the years. I’m able to time manage – and continue to improve, I’m able to recognise my limitations and find support to work around them. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My limitations are probably more around procrastination and taking action when I need to. I often feel like I need a sense of permission or validation to go ahead and do something and am still working on that coming from myself. In a work environment/career development sense, people who are proactive and get stuff done are going to be more useful for a team than someone who needs hand holding and permission to do things at every step.
        </p>
    <h3>Strengths and weaknesses</h3>
        <p>
            I work well with deadlines and accountability to others. The intersection with learning obstacles is that if I don’t put myself out there in the group to be accountable (classic introvert) I may be at risk of getting stuck and going down unnecessary rabbit holes of over-learning (i.e. get stuck researching something that’s not actually important in favour of just engaging with the group and asking for help if I need it).
        </p>
    <h3>In instance where collaboration was met with resistance or tension</h3>
        <p>
            I was working on a project with an employer on managing a transition to online classes during lockdown. I think as I became frustrated with the lack of quick action from managers, I began to feel lost and like I was wading in a pool of indecision. I also felt that my other work mates were not able to solve the problem either as there was no clear direction from management. I was definitely tense!
        </p>
        <p>
            Out of frustration, I became solution oriented (oh boy did I want to moan forever about how annoying it was) and got my flatmate on board who had relevant experience to help us with the rollout of our online classes. This took the decisions of what was being made out of the hands of managers and meant that my flatmate and I could lead the project and  deliver an outcome ASAP.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was fairly effective as within a week we had videos online to advertise our online classes. However sadly the online classes were not that successful because lockdown was basically over by the time this was achieved!
        </p>
        <p>
            I would use the same strategy in the future however the point of difference (that I’m continually learning that I need to use) is to get <strong>quicker</strong> with a solution. Moaning about problems never got anyone anywhere! I will often have a thought or solution but not voice it fast enough or wait until I’m pretty sure that everyone will agree with me. Which is not the most ideal way to deal with problems!
