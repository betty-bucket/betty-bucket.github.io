    <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
    <br>
        <h2>What is emotional intelligence?</h2>
            <p>
                Emotional intelligence is most importantly about being aware of your own feelings and how your behaviour affects others. It also extends to being aware of how others are feeling and being able to respond appropriately.
            </p>
            <p>
                Daniel Goleman (author of 1995 book – Emotional Intelligence) describes Emotional Intelligence in five components. These are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Self-awareness: </strong>The ability to understand your own emotions. People who are self-aware recognise the relationship between the things they feel and how they behave.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Self-regulation: </strong>The ability to express your emotions appropriately. People who can self-regulate are good at adapting to change and take responsibility for their own actions.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Skills: </strong>Using your self-awareness and awareness of others to work in your interactions with other people. So being able to actively listen and use both verbal and non-verbal communication.</li>
                <li><strong>Empathy: </strong>Being able to understand how someone else is feeling and interact with a compassion that allows the other person to feel seen and heard.</li>
                <li><strong>Motivation: </strong>A passion to fulfil one’s own inner goals and needs, beyond external pressures. People who are motivated are action-oriented, committed and good at taking initiative.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
            <p>IQ stands for intelligence quotient. It is a standardised test that attempts to measure someone’s intelligence. The premise behind IQ is that it is an innate ability and intelligence that cannot be improved. EQ on the other hand is malleable and able to be improved.</p>
        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
            <p>Emotional intelligence is important because it determines the quality of our relationships not only with our work colleagues, but with every relationship we have in our life. Emotional intelligence in a workplace context is often more desirable than technical skills as a good cultural fit in the team is going to make everyone involved happier. Technical skills can be taught to emotionally intelligent people, whereas (although EQ can be learn) emotional intelligence requires a commitment on the individuals part to monitor themselves and adapt behaviour accordingly.</p>
