          <h1>Learning Reflections</h1>
            <h2>My long term goal and career pathway</h2>
                <p>My long-term goal is to live a sustainable life that integrates all of my passions. It’s important to me to only be doing work that I find meaningful or personally satisfying. I imagine this looking like a performing circus artist who can support herself in quiet seasons, through injury and other life events with a job that I can do remotely. I would love to be able to present all sorts of datasets in visually engaging ways on the internet (which I know would greatly be helped by learning javascript) so that I can contribute to my circus community as well as the greater community when data is the evidence that is often needed to sway change. I seek to achieve a balance of mind and body in the work I do. I consider that the learning I am doing through dev academy will assist me in fulfilling that part of my long-term goals that craves to integrate the use of mind in my career.</p>
            <h2>The non-technical/human skills I would like to develop in myself at EDA</h2>
                <p>The ability to collaborate with other people and become a valid contributor in group scenarios. One of my biggest struggles in collaboration is finding my voice and trusting that what I have to say is valuable. Or even being able to voice that I’m not sure how to contribute at this stage and seek support.</p>
            <h2>My strengths and limitations</h2>
                <p>I am fairly good at blocking out my time and committing to doing the hours I have blocked out for myself for certain tasks. I do often leave things until the last minute but I’m very aware of the amount of work I can do in the last minute so I would say I have managed my time but I’ve chosen to stress myself out by leaving it until just before the deadline! I very rarely miss an externally set deadline and so I am often quite reliable if something absolutely needs to be done by a certain date.</p>
                <p>Although I want to improve how I collaborate with others, I do think that I contribute well to a team. I often enjoy being the systems manager of a team, structuring deadlines and assigning tasks to appropriate people. I work best by researching prior to meetings and presenting my findings in the group. However in group discussions of new ideas, I often end up quiet and unsure of how I can contribute when I haven’t done the research prior. This can be a hindrance if it’s a group brainstorming session before research is to be done!</p>
                <p>One of my other limitations is self-blocking. What I mean by this is that I can often know the steps I need to take, but I either procrastinate or use negative self-talk to avoid doing what I need to do. This can result in a fairly simple task, taking me a long time to complete for some (usually deeply rooted insecurities) reason, cause a lot of anxiety and consequently make completing the task harder and more stressful (ironically!). This is something I am aware of and recently through my meditation and journaling practices, am slowly moving through.</p>
            <h2>My commitment to managing my workload</h2>
                <p>I will continue to treat my studies like a full-time, Monday-Friday, 9-5pm job as much as possible (of course sometimes this is not achievable!). I will commit to the timeboxes as much as possible and use them as a guide for the depth of my self-education. I will also continue to engage in slack by asking questions of my facilitator when I am unable to find the answer myself, engage with people’s posts and post to the group when I have a question that is worth the whole group hearing.</p>
            <h2>My commitment to how and where I ask for help</h2>
                <p>I will get all of the learning and the majority of the tasks done by Thursday so that I have time on Friday to ask my facilitator any questions. In my own learning I will use a range of resources available to me such as freecodecamp, udacity, youtube and stackoverflow to assist me in any of the questions that will come up during my learning process. I will also keep an eye on the slack chat as people may come across problems before I do, and so I can benefit from them asking questions first! So in general the order of help seeking is my own notes>online resources>slack chat>facilitator (facilitator and slack chat could be swapped around depending on the nature of the question).</p>
            <h2>What I expect from the facilitation team at EDA</h2>
                <p>I expect the facilitation team to provide feedback on work done so far and places for improvement. I expect the facilitation team to be supportive and interested in my learning. I expect the attitude to be that no question is a dumb question, but that some questions will not get an answer (because I should be able to figure it out myself).</p>
            <h2>My other commitments and how I will manage them</h2>
                <p>I teach a few circus classes a week as well as private pilates/aerials clients. I am also committed to a few shows at the end of July which require rehearsal time until then. I also do volunteer work which is about 1-3 hours per week. On top of all of this I need to manage my own circus training so as to not completely loose it! All of this goes into my calendar, whether it’s an external obligation or me simply blocking out time in my google calendar for a task I’m committed to.</p>
