        <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
            <h2>The principles and benefits of neuroplasticity</h2>
                <p>
                    Knowing that our brains are always capable of change and growing new neural pathways is incredibly empowering. You can literally re-wire your brain. What it means is that it’s possible to change dysfunctional patterns of behaviour, develop new skills, change ways of thinking and develop new abilities. It’s what allows people to be resilient in adversity and the opposite case being a loss of synapses caused by severe stress resulting in people getting stuck in depressive ruts.
                </p>
            <h2>How I intend to use neuroplasticity for my own benefit?</h2>
                <p>
                    In my circus training life I have used some of the principles before. Admittedly I have not stuck to them so have not felt huge benefits yet but I intend to bring more visualisation into my practice so that I can create stronger neural pathways to the harder tricks that I am struggling to achieve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And in terms of learning the code for this course, well I think we have already been inadvertently doing it by relating all of the concepts we are learning with “real life” scenarios. As they say in neuroscience realms – cells that fire together, wire together – and I think the more relatable and applicable you can make your learning, the more pathways to those memories you will create and those pathways the more they are practiced and recalled will become stronger.
                </p>
            <h2>How can you increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
                <p>
                    There are many different ways you can increase your neuroplasticity. I like to think of it simply as trying to live life to the fullest and consequently the path this will take you down is one that is engaging, socially stimulating, meaningful and has a strong mindfulness/meditation practice. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Exercise is an obvious place to start as well. Exercise stimulates the release of a substance known as brain-derived neurotropic factor, which encourages the growth of new synaptic connections and strengthens the signals transmitted from neuron to neuron.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Its antithesis is stress… now I’m not going to tell you to stop being stressed or you’ll be fired but it’s worth mentioning as part of a strategy to increase neuroplasticity. How are you going to manage the inevitable stressors in your life? Meditation for one is a great tool for learning how to manage your reactions to stress and hopefully lesson the harmful consequences of too much stress on the mind and body.

        <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>
            <h2>What is it and how I relate to it</h2>
                <p>
                    A growth mindset is one that believes it is capable of change and growth vs. a fixed mindset which believes that talents and abilities are innate and fixed and cannot be improved with effort. It’s relevant in the context of learning programming because you could simply believe (I know I believed it for a long time) that you are just “not the type of person who would code” and this would be a limiting belief that actually stops you from even trying.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The growth mindset is not a new concept to me but interestingly while thinking about this, I’ve reflected on how I spoke about myself before in terms of learning programming. I would always say “I wish I was the type of person who was interested in coding” or “I wish my brain was wired that way” which upon reflection was a limiting belief that kept me away from even thinking about trying to learn programming.
                </p>
            <h2>How will I integrate the growth mindset into my learning journey?</h2>   
                <p>
                    A big part of the growth mindset that I want to take into my learning journey is making my effort meaningful and intentional. I already practice mindfulness and actively try to take on a positive mindset to my learning, however it needs a little bit more than that. As Carol Dweck has noted, the effort should be productive to be rewarded and that this effort needs to be applied to worthwhile activities. For example, I could easily go down a rabbit-hole learning about the history of javascript and put a lot of effort into this, but in terms of why I’m here at Dev Academy it would be pretty pointless. The effort would not be productive (and was probably an unexciting form of procrastination). So what I want to do more of in this learning journey, is recognise when I’m not learning or engaging, switch it up/stop and move onto an activity that is stimulating and taking me into the learning zone where my effort becomes productive.

                    I found this resource quite good for giving lots of different examples of changing mindset and how to do this in practice: <a href = "https://positivepsychology.com/growth-mindset-vs-fixed-mindset/">Growth Mindset vs Fixed Mindset</a>
