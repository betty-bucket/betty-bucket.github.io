        <h1>Summary of Foundations Core Skills</h1>
            <h2>Three things I learn about myself and my ego</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The learning about myself never stops! I think because I practice a lot of mindful exercises already, I think I thought that I might not glean any extra observations about myself through these core exercises but I still did!
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Working with a timer is really good for me! I often forget when I started working on something and it has helped me keep on track and also become more aware of my natural lulls in my attention span. For example 1hr45ish I’m definitely fading and need a proper 5-15 minute break.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        I had a fixed mindset about being a coder because I placed that identity on people who were not me. I never thought much of this belief or was ever even sad about it. But from doing the core exercises I realised that I was stereotyping what coding was and who does it and distancing myself from those stereotypes when in fact, I feel like it’s something everyone could learn if they wanted to!
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>The role of values empathy and self awareness in learning and programming</h2>
                <p>
                    Being empathetic and having good self-awareness allows us to be better contributing members of a team but also be kind towards ourselves in our own learning journey. With good empathy, we can help other students/fellow programmers in need in ways that are kind and understanding of the others struggles. With good self-awareness, you can utilise your strengths and manage your weaknesses. Self-awareness means knowing when to step away from the code, have a stretch or a meditation session and come back feeling refreshed. Self-awareness means, acknowledging your self-doubts but letting them go in favour of what is actually going to be productive and helpful to you in any situation.
                </p>
            <h2>What surprised me most in core learning</h2>
                <p>
                    Enjoying the looping exercise! I was apprehensive about reaching out to a stranger in the course because I didn’t know what to expect from them. I was pleasantly surprised that it was an enjoyable experience and that it didn’t feel awkward!
                </p>
            <h2>The most challenging parts of the core learning</h2>
                <p>
                    Keeping up some of the good self-care practices. I have fallen off my meditation band wagon a bit since the start of the course. I think that has been the most challenging part is keeping up with good self-care practices like this when the technical work feels so overwhelming and hard.
                </p>
            <h2>Why I think Dev Academy has a strong focus on core learning</h2>
                <p>
                    Basically because no one wants to hire someone with no self-awareness or an inflated ego. Better a less skilled person who has social skills and will fit in with the team than a dickhead!
                </p>
            <h2>Why I don't think studying core learning is a waste of time</h2>
                <p>
                    Being reminded of the importance of core skills, in whatever you are doing, to me feels really vital to creating a culture where those core values are really implemented and appreciated. The grind culture out in the real world is unfortunately the default so I think workplaces and study environments needs to actively rally against the grind culture by putting out there the values of mindfulness, self-awareness and empathy if we want to see a change in our working culture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, having the core learnings intertwined with the tech learnings it felt like a much needed brain break. I felt like I was still achieving something but not drilling my brain with the intricate details of code.
                </p>
        <h1>Reflecting on my learning after coming this far</h1>
            <h2>My long term goal and/or career pathway</h2>
                <p>
                    I don’t know exactly what my long-term goals are with this course and it is not my intention to have a full-time career in web development. What I’m interested in doing is adding this skillset to my tool-belt to assist me in my own personal projects and hopefully it lays the foundations for doing some self-learning in data science. I would really love to have the skills to take data and make it interactive on the internet. I have seen awesome examples of this that use JavaScript so I’m excited that I might be getting close to that aspiration.
                </p>
            <h2>What I think my biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp</h2>
                <p>
                    I think my biggest strengths will be my core skills. I have enough self-awareness to be able to walk away when I need to and take a break and can tell when the dissing self-talk gremlins are raising their ugly heads and actively manage them (shut them down).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another strength I think I’ll have is working in pairs! Although I only practiced the looping exercise with one person, I think I’m going to be able to navigate the pair programming exercises well enough.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My limitation from my sprint 2 reflections still stands in that I think I will find group work a challenge. For the reasons I mentioned previously, this is because I often go quiet and am not sure when I should use my voice. I hope to practice challenging this behaviour in Bootcamp.
                </p>
            <h2>My biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will probably be...</h2>  
                <p>
                    As mentioned above, probably finding my voice in group situations. I think I will also find keeping on track with self-care practices a challenge because I know I’m going to find the work hard and overwhelming which is usually when (ironically) the self-care practices slip.
                </p>
            <h2>The human skills I would like to see developed in myself at Bootcamp</h2>
                <p>
                    Again! Finding my voice in group situations. I would also like to improve my giving and receiving of feedback. Particularly if it’s around any core values that I need improving on (and receiving that feedback without it being a reflection of my value as a person).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Expanding from the finding my voice in group situations, I would also like to improve my leadership skills. Not necessarily to become the leader of the group and the big boss. But more just to take authority over parts of work and be proactive about things, rather than waiting for someone else to assign me a role with an expectation.
                </p>
            <h2>My expectations of myself on Bootcamp</h2>
                <p>
                    I expect of myself to survive in a way that doesn’t break my mind or body. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I expect my self-care practices and exercise regimes to stick throughout Bootcamp. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I need support, I know that Dev Academy has those tech-ins and check-ins which I will definitely be utilising! I also have a strong sense of community and support at home so I know I’ll be supported emotionally throughout Bootcamp which is so nice!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will be taking the use of a time (toggl) with me into Bootcamp as it has helped me keep on track and dedicate an appropriate amount of time to tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will meditate everyday!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will prepare my meals so that I can eat well and keep my brain fuelled on good food!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will journal! By this I mean I will set intentions and reflect on them throughout Bootcamp.
                </p>
