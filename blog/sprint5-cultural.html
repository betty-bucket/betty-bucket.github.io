        <h1>Summary of Foundations Core Skills</h1>
            <h2>Three things I learn about myself and my ego</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The learning about myself never stops! I think because I practice a lot of mindful exercises already, I think I thought that I might not glean any extra observations about myself through these core exercises but I still did!
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Working with a timer is really good for me! I often forget when I started working on something and it has helped me keep on track and also become more aware of my natural lulls in my attention span. For example 1hr45ish I’m definitely fading and need a proper 5-15 minute break.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        I had a fixed mindset about being a coder because I placed that identity on people who were not me. I never thought much of this belief or was ever even sad about it. But from doing the core exercises I realised that I was stereotyping what coding was and who does it and distancing myself from those stereotypes when in fact, I feel like it’s something everyone could learn if they wanted to!
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>The role of values empathy and self awareness in learning and programming</h2>
                <p>
                    Being empathetic and having good self-awareness allows us to be better contributing members of a team but also be kind towards ourselves in our own learning journey. With good empathy, we can help other students/fellow programmers in need in ways that are kind and understanding of the others struggles. With good self-awareness, you can utilise your strengths and manage your weaknesses. Self-awareness means knowing when to step away from the code, have a stretch or a meditation session and come back feeling refreshed. Self-awareness means, acknowledging your self-doubts but letting them go in favour of what is actually going to be productive and helpful to you in any situation.

            <h2>What surprised me most in core learning</h2>
                <p>
                    Enjoying the looping exercise! I was apprehensive about reaching out to a stranger in the course because I didn’t know what to expect from them. I was pleasantly surprised that it was an enjoyable experience and that it didn’t feel awkward!
                </p>
            <h2>The most challenging parts of the core learning</h2>
                <p>
                    Keeping up some of the good self-care practices. I have fallen off my meditation band wagon a bit since the start of the course. I think that has been the most challenging part is keeping up with good self-care practices like this when the technical work feels so overwhelming and hard.
                </p>
            <h2>Why I think Dev Academy has a strong focus on core learning</h2>
                <p>
                    Basically because no one wants to hire someone with no self-awareness or an inflated ego. Better a less skilled person who has social skills and will fit in with the team than a dickhead!
                </p>
            <h2>Why I don't think studying core learning is a waste of time</h2>
                <p>
                    Being reminded of the importance of core skills, in whatever you are doing, to me feels really vital to creating a culture where those core values are really implemented and appreciated. The grind culture out in the real world is unfortunately the default so I think workplaces and study environments needs to actively rally against the grind culture by putting out there the values of mindfulness, self-awareness and empathy if we want to see a change in our working culture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, having the core learnings intertwined with the tech learnings it felt like a much needed brain break. I felt like I was still achieving something but not drilling my brain with the intricate details of code.
